# Installing and verifying the `libtea` CLI

> **Status.** Releases are published on GitHub Releases (0.1.0 was the first;
> 0.1.1 to 0.1.6 follow it). This page describes what `.github/workflows/release.yml`
> produces. The verification commands below were run against each release from
> 0.1.0 to 0.1.6 with gh 2.103.3.

`libtea` is distributed as a GitHub release, not on crates.io (`libtea-cli` is
`publish = false`). Each release carries, for version `X.Y.Z`:

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `libtea-X.Y.Z-<target>.tar.gz` / `.zip` | the binary, `LICENSE`, `README.md` |
| `libtea-X.Y.Z.cdx.json` | CycloneDX 1.5 SBOM of the CLI's dependency tree |
| `SHA256SUMS` | SHA-256 of every file above |

Targets: `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`,
`aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`,
`x86_64-apple-darwin`, `aarch64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
(`.zip`). The macOS x86_64 binary is cross-compiled and is not run by the
release smoke test.

**Linux: gnu or musl.** The gnu archives are built on `ubuntu-24.04` and link
the system glibc. Measured on the v0.1.0 archives, both gnu archives need
**glibc 2.34 or newer** (the highest `GLIBC_x.y` version they reference is
2.34; found by scanning the binary's version strings, as `readelf` was not
available). That covers Ubuntu 22.04 and later, Debian 12 and later, and
RHEL 9 and later; it does not cover Ubuntu 20.04, Debian 11 or RHEL 8. The musl
archives are statically linked and are the portable choice: use them on older
distributions, on Alpine, and in minimal containers. The baseline is the runner
image named in `release.yml`; a later release may raise it and will say so in
the changelog.

Every file is also covered by a GitHub build-provenance attestation. A release
is created as a **draft** by the workflow and published by a maintainer by hand
after checking it; only published releases are meant for installation.

## Verify, then install

```sh
VERSION=X.Y.Z
TARGET=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
BASE=https://github.com/Mehrn0ush/libtea-rs/releases/download/v$VERSION
curl -fLO "$BASE/libtea-$VERSION-$TARGET.tar.gz"
curl -fLO "$BASE/SHA256SUMS"

# 1. The download is the file that was released (corruption, truncation).
sha256sum --check --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS      # macOS: shasum -a 256 -c
# 2. The file was produced by this repository's release workflow, for this tag.
gh attestation verify "libtea-$VERSION-$TARGET.tar.gz" \
  --repo Mehrn0ush/libtea-rs \
  --signer-workflow Mehrn0ush/libtea-rs/.github/workflows/release.yml \
  --source-ref "refs/tags/v$VERSION"

tar -xzf "libtea-$VERSION-$TARGET.tar.gz"
install -m 0755 "libtea-$VERSION-$TARGET/libtea" ~/.local/bin/libtea
libtea --version
```

`libtea --version` prints `libtea X.Y.Z`; it should show the version you downloaded.

The `gh attestation verify` command above was verified with gh 2.103.3 and needs
a `gh` that has `--source-ref`. With an older `gh`, check the signing workflow
and tag with `--cert-identity` instead (it cannot be combined with
`--signer-workflow`, so use one or the other):

```sh
gh attestation verify "libtea-$VERSION-$TARGET.tar.gz" \
  --repo Mehrn0ush/libtea-rs \
  --cert-identity "https://github.com/Mehrn0ush/libtea-rs/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/v$VERSION"
```

On macOS, a binary downloaded through a browser may be quarantined and refused
at first run. After verifying it, remove the flag with
`xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <file>`. Files fetched with `curl` as above are
not quarantined.

On Windows, download the `.zip`, check it with
`(Get-FileHash .\libtea-X.Y.Z-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip).Hash` against
`SHA256SUMS`, run the same `gh attestation verify` (including `--source-ref`),
and unzip.

To read the SBOM: `libtea-X.Y.Z.cdx.json` is plain JSON.

## What each check proves, and what it does not

- **`SHA256SUMS`** is served from the same release as the archives. It catches
  a damaged or partial download. It is **not** an independent proof of origin:
  whoever could replace the archive could replace this file.
- **The attestation** states that GitHub Actions ran this repository's release
  workflow at a recorded commit and produced a file with that digest. It
  does not say the source is free of defects or malicious changes, that the
  maintainers reviewed it, or that the toolchain and runner were trustworthy.
  `gh attestation verify` checks it against GitHub's records. Pass
  `--signer-workflow` and `--source-ref` as shown: without them an
  attestation made by some other workflow, or by the same workflow for another
  tag, or a branch, would satisfy the check, and so would an older
  release's genuine archive renamed to the version you asked for. With
  `--source-ref "refs/tags/v$VERSION"` the attestation must be for the tag you
  are installing. Archives and the SBOM carry the full tag version in their
  names (a tag `v1.2.3-rc.1` gives `libtea-1.2.3-rc.1-...`), and
  the release workflow refuses to attest any other set of file names.
- **The SBOM** lists what `Cargo.lock` resolves for the CLI at the tagged
  commit. It is an inventory, not a vulnerability assessment.
- **Not provided:** the binaries are not code-signed or notarized. macOS
  Gatekeeper and Windows SmartScreen may warn about them. The build is not
  claimed to be bit-for-bit reproducible (archives are deterministic given the
  binary; the compiler output is not verified to be).

## In GitHub Actions

`docs/github-action.md` describes an action that does the download, the
SHA-256 check and the attestation check for you and then runs a command.

## Build from source instead

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Mehrn0ush/libtea-rs && cd libtea-rs
git checkout vX.Y.Z
cargo build --release --locked -p libtea-cli     # needs Rust 1.89 or newer
```
