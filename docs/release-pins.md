# Release pins

The release workflow and the Action use third-party code. Every `uses:` of a
third-party action is pinned to a full commit SHA with a `# vX.Y.Z` comment, and
the SBOM tool has an exact version. Pinned on 2026-11-08:

| What | Where | Pin | Release |

On 2026-11-09 `actions/checkout` and `actions/upload-artifact` were moved to
releases that run on Node 24 (`runs.using: node24`; the previous checkout pin
produced a "Node.js 20 is deprecated" notice on every CI job). Each SHA was
resolved from the tag two ways (`commits/<tag>` and `git/ref/tags/<tag>`) and
the two agreed.

Each SHA was resolved from the tag two ways (`gh api repos/<action>/commits/<tag>`
and the tag ref `git/ref/tags/<tag>`, dereferenced if annotated) and the two
agreed. `upload-artifact` v7 and `download-artifact` v8 are the current releases
of each; they are not the same major version. `cargo install cargo-cyclonedx
--version 0.5.10 --locked` was run in a scratch directory and `scripts/make-sbom.sh`
was run with it (157 components for the CLI). Since then the release workflow
has run with these pins for every tag from `v0.1.0` to `v0.1.6`, except
`dtolnay/rust-toolchain`: tags up to `v0.1.5` used the `master` commit
`e2a55d2f`, and `v0.1.6` (run 43182817134) is the first with the `v1` commit
`683b588c`.

Every third-party action is pinned by SHA. `taiki-e/install-action` (in
`ci.yml`, for `cargo-audit` and `cargo-semver-checks`) is pinned to v2.87.32
(`5488ac5a951645ce95062214902ac4b6bc1a1037`, released 2026-10-26; the commit and
tag lookups agreed), with the tool named in `with: tool:`. The newest release at
the time, v2.90.3, was three days old and was not used.

`dtolnay/rust-toolchain` has one release tag, `v1`, which moves with `master`.
It is pinned to the commit `v1` pointed to on 2026-11-12
(`683b588c487a69d01f6c6ddf40f036ff682cc2c8`, committed 2026-10-16, "Add 1.99.1
patch release"; it was also the `master` tip), and the comment gives that date:
`# v1 2026-10-16`. (Until 2026-11-12 the pin was a `master` commit whose comment
said "no release tags"; that was wrong, the `v1` tag existed.)

**Two-week rule.** A new pin is a release (or, for `rust-toolchain`, a commit)
at least 14 days old, so that a compromised or broken release has had time to
be noticed. Dependabot proposes the newest release regardless; such a pull
request waits until the release is old enough.

**Dependabot bumps must update this file.** Every SHA pin must appear in the
table above with its release, and the release in the `uses:` comment must match
the table. `every_sha_pin_names_its_release` in
`crates/tea-cli/tests/workflow_policy.rs` checks the comment format and the
table, so a Dependabot pull request that changes a SHA fails CI until the table
here is updated by hand (and the two-week rule checked).
`unpinned_third_party_actions_are_exactly_the_known_debt` fails on a new
unpinned action.

## The gate

- `scripts/check-pins.sh --release` is the first step of the release workflow,
  after checkout. A tag cannot produce a release while any `PIN_ME_*`
  placeholder is present. It never honors the development flag below.
- `cargo test` (`unresolved_pins_block_unless_the_documented_flag_is_set` in
  `crates/tea-cli/tests/pin_gate.rs`) fails while a placeholder is present,
  unless `LIBTEA_ALLOW_PIN_PLACEHOLDERS=1` is set. The flag is for development
  only and is no longer set anywhere in `ci.yml`; a test fails if it comes back.
- A placeholder in a `uses:` would also make GitHub fail the job at setup.

## Refreshing a pin

To move a pin, or to redo this from placeholders, the commands below apply.
`the_documented_commands_resolve_every_placeholder` runs the `pins-apply` block
in a scratch copy of the repository (turned back into placeholders first) with
made-up values.

Run from the repository root with the `gh` CLI logged in. Take the SHA from the
repository named, never from a blog post or another workflow, and read each
release's notes before choosing a tag.

```sh
# 1. The latest release tag of each action (choose a tag you trust).
for action in upload-artifact download-artifact attest-build-provenance cache; do
  printf '%s  ' "$action"
  gh api "repos/actions/$action/releases/latest" --jq .tag_name
done

# 2. Resolve the tag you chose to a commit SHA (works for annotated and
#    lightweight tags). Replace each <TAG> with the tag from step 1.
UPLOAD_SHA=$(gh api repos/actions/upload-artifact/commits/<TAG> --jq .sha)
DOWNLOAD_SHA=$(gh api repos/actions/download-artifact/commits/<TAG> --jq .sha)
ATTEST_SHA=$(gh api repos/actions/attest-build-provenance/commits/<TAG> --jq .sha)
CACHE_SHA=$(gh api repos/actions/cache/commits/<TAG> --jq .sha)
printf '%s\n' "$UPLOAD_SHA" "$DOWNLOAD_SHA" "$ATTEST_SHA" "$CACHE_SHA"   # four 40-hex lines

# 3. The cargo-cyclonedx version: the first line reads  cargo-cyclonedx = "X.Y.Z".
cargo search cargo-cyclonedx --limit 1
CYCLONEDX=X.Y.Z    # the number from that line
```

Then apply them (this block is tested: `the_documented_commands_resolve_every_placeholder`
runs it in a scratch copy with made-up values):

```sh pins-apply
perl -pi -e "s/PIN_ME_UPLOAD_ARTIFACT/$UPLOAD_SHA/g" .github/workflows/release.yml
perl -pi -e "s/PIN_ME_DOWNLOAD_ARTIFACT/$DOWNLOAD_SHA/g" .github/workflows/release.yml
perl -pi -e "s/PIN_ME_ATTEST_BUILD_PROVENANCE/$ATTEST_SHA/g" .github/workflows/release.yml
perl -pi -e "s/PIN_ME_CARGO_CYCLONEDX_VERSION/$CYCLONEDX/g" .github/workflows/release.yml
perl -pi -e "s/PIN_ME_ACTIONS_CACHE/$CACHE_SHA/g" action.yml
# Retire the development flag: every line that mentions it (the comment and the setting).
perl -ni -e 'print unless /LIBTEA_ALLOW_PIN_PLACEHOLDERS/' .github/workflows/ci.yml
./scripts/check-pins.sh --release
```

After that:

```sh
git diff --stat                 # release.yml, action.yml, ci.yml only
cargo test -p libtea-cli --test pin_gate --test workflow_policy --test action_policy
```

with the flag **unset**. Commit the three files together.

## Also before the first tag

1. `scripts/make-sbom.sh` was run with `cargo-cyclonedx` 0.5.10. That run showed
   that the tool writes one SBOM per workspace member, which the script did not
   expect; it now keeps the CLI's SBOM and removes the rest
   (`make_sbom_keeps_the_cli_sbom_when_the_tool_writes_one_per_member`). The
   workflow's `sbom` job has still not run on GitHub.
2. Create the `release` Environment and the tag ruleset described in
   `docs/release-checklist.md` ("Repository settings required before the first
   tag"). The workflow runs both privileged jobs in that Environment; without a
   required reviewer it stops nothing, and without the tag ruleset anyone who can
   push a tag can start a run.
3. Follow the release order in `docs/release-checklist.md`; the workflow's first run is the real tag.

The tag-pinned actions in `ci.yml` and the other workflows are listed above.
